Welcome to my Java practice programs repository!

This repository contains various Java programs I've written for practice purposes. The programs cover various topics and concepts, including:

* Basic syntax and data types
* Control flow statements
* Loops and arrays
* Methods and classes
* Object-oriented programming
* Strings and string manipulation
* File I/O
* And more!
* Navigating the repository:

Each program is stored in a separate folder within the repository.
Each folder contains the Java source file and any additional files related to the program (e.g., input data, test cases).
A brief description of each program is provided within the respective folder.

Using the programs:

Requirements: Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

Compiling and running:
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the desired program folder.
Use the following command to compile the program: javac <program_name>.java
Run the compiled program using: java <program_name>

Additional notes:
Some programs may require additional input or configuration, refer to the program description for details.
Feel free to modify and experiment with the programs to expand your understanding.
